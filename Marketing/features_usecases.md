## 50 Features

### Core Architecture

1. **Single binary** — ~15MB, just drop it and run

3. **Cross-platform** — macOS (ARM64/x64), Windows (x64), Linux (x64)
4. **Zero dependencies** — no Node, no Python, no Docker, no runtime
5. **WebSocket multiplexing** — all terminals over one connection

10. **HMAC-SHA256 session tokens** — cryptographically signed, not guessable
11. **3-week sliding expiry** — stay logged in, but with limits
12. **Rate limiting** — 5 fails = 30s lockout, 10 fails = 5min lockout
13. **Mandatory password** — can't skip during install, we're not playing

## The Vibe

You're not chained to a desk anymore.

Your terminals run where your power is. You access them from wherever you are.

HTTP goes where SSH fears to tread.

**15MB. Zero dependencies. Any browser.**

That's it. That's the pitch.
